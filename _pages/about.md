Hi! I am **Kaichuang Yang (杨开创)**, an **incoming PhD student** in the **Statistics Program** at **King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)**, supervised by [Prof. Håvard Rue](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/haavard-rue). My current research interests include **Statistics**, **Bayesian Optimization**, **Optimal Transport**, **Bioinformatics**, and **INLA**.

Before joining KAUST, I obtained my MSc degree in Statistical Science from the **University of Oxford**, where I was honoured to work under the supervision of [Dr. Jakob Zeitler](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/find-an-expert/jakob-zeitler) on **Bayesian Optimization**.  Earlier, I earned my BSc degree in **Mathematics with Statistics** at the **University of Southampton**, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wei Liu](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wxym9/professor-wei-liu). My final-year mathematics project focused on **Data-centric AI** and **Mix-sample Data Augmentation**.  I also hold a BEcon in Financial Statistics and Risk Management (Guanghua Elite Class) from the **Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)**, where I was kindly supervised by [Prof. Yaowu Liu](https://yaowuliu.github.io/) and completed my dissertation on **Spatio-Temporal Modelling**. My BSc at the University of Southampton is partly supported by the SWUFE Dual Degree Exchange Scholarship and the School of Statistics. 

After completing my MSc, I visited Japan as a Research Intern at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)](https://www.oist.jp/), where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Makoto Yamada](https://oist.mlds.jp/) on **Optimal Transport**. During my undergraduate years, I spent two summers in Hong Kong. One was at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/), where I was awarded the [2023 PolyU RPg Summer School](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/news-and-events/news/2023/0719_rpg-summer-school-2023/?sc_lang=en) Scholarship. The other was at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supported by the [Turing Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_scheme) and the University of Southampton to participate in the 2024 CUHK Summer Undergraduate Research Programme. Under the supervision of [Prof. Christopher K. C. Lai](https://mic.cuhk.edu.hk/christopher-k-c-lai/), I co-authored a paper on **Bioinformatics**, which was accepted by [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). During my second summer at SWUFE, I conducted research in **NLP** at the [SWUFE Fintech Innovation Center](https://www.linkedin.com/companyfintech-innovation-center/), supervised by [Prof. Zheng Yu](https://jinrong.swufe.edu.cn/info/2039/23527.htm). There, I led the development of the [SWUFE-BERT Project](https://github.com/KaichuangYang/SWUFE-BERT-Extract-Summary).
