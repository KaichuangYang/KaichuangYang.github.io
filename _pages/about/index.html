<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! I am <strong>Kaichuang Yang (杨开创)</strong>, an <strong>incoming PhD student</strong> in the <strong>Statistics Program</strong> at <strong>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</strong>, I have the privilege of being supervised by <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/haavard-rue" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Håvard Rue</a>. My current research interests include <strong>Statistics</strong>, <strong>Bayesian Optimization</strong>, <strong>Optimal Transport</strong>, <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>, and <strong>INLA</strong>.</p> <p>Before joining KAUST, I obtained my MSc degree in Statistical Science from the <strong>University of Oxford</strong>, where I was honoured to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/find-an-expert/jakob-zeitler" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Jakob Zeitler</a> on <strong>Bayesian Optimization</strong>. Earlier, I earned my BSc degree in <strong>Mathematics with Statistics</strong> at the <strong>University of Southampton</strong>, where I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wxym9/professor-wei-liu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Wei Liu</a>. My final-year mathematics project focused on <strong>Data-centric AI</strong> and <strong>Mix-sample Data Augmentation</strong>. I also hold a BEcon in Financial Statistics and Risk Management (Guanghua Elite Class) from the <strong>Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)</strong>, where I was kindly supervised by <a href="https://yaowuliu.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yaowu Liu</a> and completed my dissertation on <strong>Spatio-Temporal Modelling</strong>. My BSc study at the University of Southampton is partly supported by the SWUFE Dual Degree Exchange Scholarship and the School of Statistics.</p> <p>After completing my MSc, I visited Japan as a <a href="https://www.oist.jp/admissions/research-internship/apply-research-internship" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Research Intern</a> at the <a href="https://www.oist.jp/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)</a>, where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of <a href="https://oist.mlds.jp/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Makoto Yamada</a> on <strong>Optimal Transport</strong>. During my undergraduate years, I spent two summers in Hong Kong. One was at the <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a>, where I was awarded the <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/news-and-events/news/2023/0719_rpg-summer-school-2023/?sc_lang=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2023 PolyU RPg Summer School</a> Scholarship. The other was at the <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a>, supported by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_scheme" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Turing Scholarship</a> and the University of Southampton to participate in the 2024 <a href="https://www.summer.cuhk.edu.hk/surp/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CUHK Summer Undergraduate Research Programme</a>. Under the supervision of <a href="https://mic.cuhk.edu.hk/christopher-k-c-lai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Christopher K. C. Lai</a>, I co-authored a paper on <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>, which was accepted by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Computational Biology</a>. During my second summer at SWUFE, I conducted research in <strong>NLP</strong> at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/companyfintech-innovation-center/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SWUFE Fintech Innovation Center</a>, supervised by <a href="https://jinrong.swufe.edu.cn/info/2039/23527.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yu Zheng</a>. There, I led the development of the <a href="https://github.com/KaichuangYang/SWUFE-BERT-Extract-Summary" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SWUFE-BERT Project</a>.</p> <p>The website is currently under construction….</p> </body></html>
